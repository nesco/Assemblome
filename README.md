## Introduction

Assemblome aims to bridge the gap between genetic data and individuals with diverse technical backgrounds. It allows users to define genetic elements, their attributes, and relationships in simple `.asb` files, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of genetic information without requiring in-depth biological expertise.

## Features

- **Tag System:** Define and manage genetic elements (tags) with associated attributes and types.
- **Relationships:** Establish connections between genetic elements to represent relationships.
- **Parsing:** Read and interpret `.asb` files to populate the tag and relationship structures.
- **Querying:** Perform queries to retrieve specific genetic elements and explore relationships.
